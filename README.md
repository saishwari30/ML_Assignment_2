# Titanic Survival Prediction – ML Assignment 2

## a. Problem Statement
The objective is to build multiple classification models to predict passenger
survival on the Titanic and deploy them using a Streamlit web application.

## b. Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains 891 passenger records with demographic and travel
information. The target variable is Survived (binary classification).
